# CPmodelHD
Extension of the CP model.


## Abstract
Cells possess a plastic characteristic, meaning they can alter their phenotype and behaviour in response to physical or physiological perturbations. Although well recognized in embryonic differentiation, cellular plasticity is also essential for tissue adaptation and regeneration in adult cells. The molecular basis involves complex, time-dependent cascades, yet few mathematical frameworks exist to predict such dynamic behaviours. Addressing this gap, the Yu Group developed the Control Point (CP) Model to study cell plasticity, where it fits well into omics data, and identifies attractor states characterized by distinct temporal signatures and molecular markers. However, its implementation analyses each molecular feature independently, limiting the detection of coordinated molecular patterns. Here, we report an updated algorithm that extends the model’s capability to process bulk data across multiple genes simultaneously. A comparative analysis with the established CP model revealed discrepancies in attractor state identification, although the extended model remained consistent with known biological knowledge. Future efforts should focus on refining input parameters and optimizing the framework to ensure interpretable outcomes.
